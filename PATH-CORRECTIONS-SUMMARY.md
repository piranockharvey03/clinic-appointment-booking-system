9. **admin-logout.php**
   - ✅ Already correct (redirects to `../html/admin-login.html`)

## Path Correction Rules Applied

### For PHP files in `php/` folder linking to other PHP files:
- **Before**: `../html/patient-dashboard.php` or `../php/logout.php`
- **After**: `patient-dashboard.php` or `logout.php`
- **Reason**: PHP files are in the same folder, use relative paths without directory prefix

### For PHP files in `php/` folder linking to HTML files:
- **Before**: Various inconsistent paths
- **After**: `../html/filename.html`
- **Reason**: HTML files are in the `html/` folder, need to go up one level then into html/

### For PHP files in `php/` folder linking to assets:
- **Correct**: `../assets/css/style.css` or `../assets/js/script.js`
- **Status**: Already correct, no changes needed
